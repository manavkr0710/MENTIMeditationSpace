## About MENTIMeditationSpace
This program is one of the applications of the MENTI Mental Health and Wellness chatbot/activity tracker. 
The Meditation Space application is a GUI that allows the user to set a time limit for the meditating. It also 
plays calming music in the background, as well as a moving background of an image of waves.

## Why use MENTIMeditationSpace
This program allows the user to clear their mind with calming music playing in the background. 
There is a timer that the user can enter an amount of seconds to set the timer for meditating. While the timer is counting down,
the user can choose to either rest their eyes and listen to calming the calming music playing in the background, 
or they can choose to admire the moving background of the waves. It helps relieve stress, which is the main focus of our main project;
Mental Health and Wellbeing.
